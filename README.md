# MEGACORP

This silly lil game started life years ago when I wrote what is now the prologue as one of my first projects for a class on Unity. I just started thinking about all the ways I could add to it and expand on the ideas, having fun with the themes of mundane corporate drudgery in a cyberpunk setting.

Right now it's just loading up the prologue event - I want to finish a little tool to help write the structured content (with all the effects, requirements, etc) so that it goes faster!

Works best in Firefox - Chrome seems to choke on the text-shadow burn-in effect (which looks cool so I am leaving it!) and Safari just barely even works at all. So... probably will require fixes (mostly removing the text-shadow, I think though maybe also shadows over svg is causing issues for Safari) for a 'final' version unless these rendering peculiarities get sorted.

I'd like to move it to Typescript (would help with all the game data for sure)!
