TODOS:
; repurpose next on option
; gameEnd or eventEnd are protected terms.
; refactor event deck
;   each event within events will have a key details
;   details has lvlreq, flagreq, random, repeatable
;   events.js will include qualifying event serve function
;   On need we qualify an event deck and select from it
;   list of completed events to filter
refactor flags object
  describe all possible from events.js
implement a gameover - cant just load event, need to hit title
implement focus effect on performance
  part of the advance
implement performance leading to promotion/demotion
implement optional option qualification -
  in terms of option data, and in terms of render
  render disabled options?
test the event advancer
animate popup
handle input freeze
  disable listeners and dim main content
Add a disabled state to option that disables hover and all listeners

make new SVG have a larger viewBox - this will make the max size larger while not impacting lower end scaling
figure out the text-shadow problem with typeout etc. I think its too expensive. Maybe have to drop it as an effect (or make it switchable)


NOTES ON NEXT CHANGES
events changes
  implement an event queue
    [150] array with nothing to start
    force events into the the start of the array
    every advance grab the top of queue
    if empty its random event
    if named its that event
  after prologue completion, force an activity monitor event 1-3 events
  at app start, build event meta and flags roundup
  random event checks again event meta, not full obj
find ways to bring order to the engine
  only set state inside of game.js
  separate mutators and setters/getters
  test the mutators input/return (no side effects)
try/catch/finally
test coverage
