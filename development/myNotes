TODO figure out the text-shadow problem with typeout etc. I think its too expensive. Maybe have to drop it as an effect (or make it switchable)

input handler 
disable further input.
process the input. (option exe)
  valid input makes stuff happen. 
  invalid output does nothing, shows error, re-enables input.

end of option animation enables input

effects:
  job
    performance +/-
    time +
    promotion
    demotion
    new department
  flags
    true/false
  events
    add
effects: {
  job: {
    performanceChange: 0,
    timePassed: 1,
    promotion: true,
    demotion: false,
    newDept: false,
  },
  flags: {},
  events: [],
  eventComplete: false,
  alert: 'Alert message',
  gameOver: true
},

after all that:
check performance for promotion/demotion
check attention for affect on performance

event selector:
shuffle event deck
go through one at a time to see if qualified
(by level, flag, etc)
if reach the end of deck with no viable events, you lose
'you've hit a real wall in your career. you kinda just give up'


TODOS:
set up eventAdvance
  set up event selector
    filter for qualifying events
      select one
      if none, end game
implement a gameover
implement focus effect on performance
implement performance leading to promotion/demotion
implement option qualification -
  in terms of option data, and in terms of render
test the event advancer
turn popup into an alert thing
  on message change - popup
  while open disable other input ? freeze text load?
  when close reenable input
  alerts when promoted/demoted or focus affects performance rating

Add a disabled state to option that disables hover and all listeners

make new SVG have a larger viewBox - this will make the max size larger while not impacting lower end scaling
