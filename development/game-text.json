Congrats on your promotion to an Associate Project Manager role in the Consumer Nanotech division! The higher ups are sure to start taking notice of you now!

1. Get to work!
2. Start feeling out the department politics...

title: More Content Tbd...
Lorem Ipsum placeholder jibber jabber.

1. Get to work!
2. Actually, this is just a temporary job to pay the bills while I pursue my true passion, game development.

title: You make a game!
You spend the next three years coasting in the mail room, while working nose the grindstone every night and weekend at home on your passion project - an open-world, grim-dark version of that one Genesis game with Cool Spot. First, you learn how to code and use modern game engines, then take a few skillshare courses to pick up some basic skills in digital art. You toil away and eventually get together something resembling the game you envisioned, with reasonable compromises here and there.

1. Release the game guerrilla style!
2. Release the game after sensibly investing in some modest marketing.

title: Your game isn't good
You sell 124 copies of your game but most of those sales are probably down to the excellent cover artwork you paid an art student 100 zonkoCredits to make for you. You've wasted three years of your life. At least you've become good friends with your manager in the mail room, Merle. He even played your game start to finish, and thought it was pretty ok.

1. Decide it's time to take this Megacorp job seriously
2. Stick to your guns! Work on your next idea, a space shooter with a real time trading economy and complicated romance trees with aliens.

#GameOverSlides
title: You are fired
Merle loves your new idea when you tell him all about it, but he still has to fire you because you never get anything done at your very simple job in the mail room. But he can't wait to play the new game. With all the time on your hands to work on it, it'll probably be great. Right?

1. Start over
2. Fuck this I'm gonna go make that game!

title: You've made it
You're the Vice President of Nanotechnology at Megacorp! You're a VP. After years of fastidious boot-licking, you're in upper management. The vacation package alone makes it all worth while.
After one year in the role, you're forced out because they're 'taking the company in another direction.' Seems you took a little too long to get here. But with the severance you buy an island. Enjoy retirement!

1. Start Over
2. Enjoy that island living.

#TheClimb
Moving up!

You work hard for two years and earn a minor promotion! Woohoo! Making progress here.

1. Great!

Conquering Consumer Nanotech!

Congrats on your promotion to a {title+1} role in the Consumer Nanotech division! The higher ups are sure to start taking notice of you now!

1. Nose to the grindstone...
2. Start feeling out the department politics...
